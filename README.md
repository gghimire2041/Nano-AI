## ChatGPT (OpenAI)

### 🧠 **Decoder-only Transformer + RLHF**

Revolutionary conversational AI using GPT's autoregressive architecture enhanced with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for alignment and safety.

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

**Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Input Token Embedding + Positional Encoding**
2. **Pre-LayerNorm → Multi-Head Self-Attention**
3. **Residual Connection + Pre-LayerNorm**
4. **Feed-Forward Network (GELU Activation)**
5. **Output Layer → Next Token Prediction**

### 🔧 Key Innovations

- **Pre-Layer Normalization**: Applies LayerNorm before attention/FFN blocks for better gradient flow and training stability
- **GELU Activation**: Gaussian Error Linear Units provide smoother, probabilistic activation compared to ReLU
- **RLHF Training**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback aligns model outputs with human preferences
- **Causal Masking**: Ensures autoregressive generation - each token only attends to previous tokens

### 📊 Technical Specifications

| Component | Specification | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Architecture | Decoder-only Transformer | Autoregressive text generation |
| Attention | Multi-head self-attention | Learn token relationships |
| Activation | GELU | Smooth, probabilistic activation |
| Training | Supervised + RLHF | Human alignment & safety |

## Grok (xAI)

### ⚡ **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**

Elon Musk's unconventional AI using Mixture of Experts architecture for efficient scaling. Routes different query types to specialized expert networks dynamically.

### 🏗️ MoE Architecture

**Expert Routing Flow:**
```
Input Token → Gating Network → Expert Selection → Specialized Processing → Weighted Output
```

**Example:**
- Input: "What is AI?"
- **Expert 1**: Tech Knowledge
- **Expert 2**: Science Concepts  
- **Expert 3**: Mathematical Foundations
- **Expert 4**: General Knowledge
- Output: Top-2 experts activated (e.g., Tech + Science)

### 🔧 Key Innovations

- **Expert Routing**: Gating network selects top-k experts for each token, enabling specialization without full activation
- **Sparse Activation**: Only 2-8 experts activate per token, achieving massive scale with constant compute cost
- **Load Balancing**: Auxiliary loss ensures experts are utilized evenly, preventing expert collapse
- **Specialized Knowledge**: Different experts learn different domains (math, code, reasoning, creativity)

### 📊 Technical Specifications

| Component | Configuration | Benefit |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Experts | 8-64 specialist networks | Domain specialization |
| Routing | Top-K selection (K=2) | Efficient computation |
| Gating | Learnable router network | Dynamic expert selection |
| Scaling | Constant compute, more experts | Massive capacity growth |

## Gemini (Google)

### 💎 **Multimodal Transformer**

Google's most capable multimodal AI, natively processing text, images, audio, and code. Uses advanced attention mechanisms for efficiency and multimodal understanding.

### 🏗️ Multimodal Architecture

**Multi-Query Attention Flow:**
```
Query Projection (Multi-head) → Shared K,V Projection (Single) → Combined Output
```

**Efficiency Innovation:**
- Traditional: Separate K,V for each head
- Gemini: Shared K,V across all heads
- Result: Reduced memory, faster inference

### 🔧 Key Innovations

- **Multi-Query Attention**: Shared key/value projections across attention heads reduce memory and increase inference speed
- **SwiGLU Activation**: Swish-Gated Linear Units combine sigmoid gating with Swish activation for better performance
- **RoPE Encoding**: Rotary Position Encoding provides better length generalization and relative position understanding
- **Native Multimodality**: Joint training on text, images, audio from the start, not adapters or separate encoders

### 📊 Architecture Improvements

| Innovation | Traditional | Gemini Improvement |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Attention | Multi-head (separate K,V) | Multi-query (shared K,V) |
| Position | Absolute encoding | Rotary Position Encoding |
| Activation | ReLU/GELU | SwiGLU (gated activation) |
| Modality | Text-only, then adapted | Native multimodal training |
